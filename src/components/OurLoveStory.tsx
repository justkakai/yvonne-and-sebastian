                    Sebastian and Yvonne met in December 2016 and it was a story of coincidence or fate or God who connected them. Yvonne was in Hamburg living with her host family at the time and Sebastian was visiting his parents in LÃ¼beck.
                    When he was driving back home to Frankfurt, he stopped by Hamburg and decided to use the dating app OkCupid.

                    On the other side of town, Yvonne was doing the same. One thing to know about those apps, they work with location so the closer people are, you will be connected together. Yvonne texted Sebastian, because she was so impressed by his profile and the app matched their compatibility to over 90%! Since the first text was sent, the two connected and their relationship started to grow.

                    They were in a long-distance relationship for the first four years, while they both completed their studies. During the start of the pandemic in 2020, they moved in together in Berlin where they currently still live.
